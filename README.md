# Message Vault for NextCloud
⚠️ We're currently in the very early stages of beta testing and things may not be working correctly yet. ⚠️

The Message Vault is takes XML backups from the Android app "SMS Backup & Restore" and
imports them into the Nextcloud database for easily viewing.
Support is baked in for importing of:

- Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) 
- Rich Communication Services messages (RCS/Google Chat)
- Short Message Service (SMS) 
- Files and attachments are supported and will restore to `./.messagevault`
